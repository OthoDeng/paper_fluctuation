	abstract = {While the warming trends of Earth’s mean temperature are evident at climatological scales, the local temperature at shorter time scales are highly ﬂuctuating. Here we show that the probabilities of such ﬂuctuations are characterized by a special symmetry typical of small systems out of equilibrium. Their nearly universal properties are linked to the ﬂuctuation theorem and reveal that the progressive warming is accompanied by growing asymmetry of temperature distributions. These statistics allow us to project the global temperature variability in the near future, in line with predictions from climate models, providing original insight about future extremes.},

The analysis highlights the inﬂuence of methodological assumptions on the estimates of design wind speed corresponding to 50-year and 500-year return period. The results demonstrate that the MIS method leads to more stable quantile estimates than the POT method.},

	abstract = {Wind energy production is very sensitive to turbulent wind speed. Thus rapid variation of wind speed due to changes in the local meteorological conditions can lead to electrical power variations of the order of the nominal power output, in particular when wind power variations on very short time scales, range at few seconds to 1 h, are considered. In small grid as they exist on islands (Guadeloupean Archipelago: French West Indies) such ﬂuctuations can cause instabilities in case of intermediate power shortages. The developed analysis in [14] reveals three main classes of time series for the wind speed ﬂuctuations. In this work, Probability Density Functions (PDFs) are proposed to ﬁt the wind speed ﬂuctuations distributions in each class. After, to simulate wind speed ﬂuctuations sequences, we use a stochastic differential equation, the Langevin equation considering Gaussian turbulence PDF (class I), Gram–Charlier PDF (class II) and a mixture of gaussian PDF (class III). The statistical and dynamical properties of simulated wind sequences are close to those of measured wind sequences, for each class.},

We show that the class of limiting distributions of such random sums, as the number of terms converges to infinity, consists of multivariate asymmetric distributions that are natural generalizations of univariate Laplace laws. We call these limits multivariate asymmetric Laplace laws. We give an explicit form of their multidimensional densities and show representations that effectively facilitate computer simulation of variates from this class. We also discuss the relation to other formerly considered classes of distributions containing Laplace laws.},

	abstract = {As the planet warms, climate models predict that rain will become heavier but less frequent and that the circulation will weaken. Here, two heuristic models relating moisture, vertical velocity, and rainfall distributions are developed—one in which the distribution of vertical velocity is prescribed and another in which it is predicted. These models are used to explore the response to warming and moistening as well as changes in circulation, atmospheric energy budget, and stability. Some key assumptions of the models include that relative humidity is ﬁxed within and between climate states and that stability is constant within each climate state. The ﬁrst model shows that an increase in skewness of the vertical velocity distribution is crucial for capturing salient characteristics of the changing distribution of rain, including the muted rate of mean precipitation increase relative to extremes and the decrease in the total number or area of rain events. The second model suggests that this increase in the skewness of the vertical velocity arises from the asymmetric impact of latent heating on vertical motion.},
